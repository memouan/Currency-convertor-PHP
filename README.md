<h2>The Mission</h2>
<p>
    Dreaming about going on vacation after the course? Going somewhere far, far away? What if we were thirsty from climbing the table mountain in South-Africa right now, or sunbathing a nice Hawaiian beach and in dire need of a cocktail? One thing is for sure - we'd need to calculate how many Euros that way-too-expensive drink will be üí∏
</p>
<h1>Specifications</h1>
<h2>üå± Must haves</h2>
<p>Your next travel destination and check the exchange rate: local currency / Euros.
    Make a small webpage where you can enter the local rate (use a form), and it'll tell you the price in Euros. A simple calculation will do, no need to get updated rates from external API's.
    Use a form that submits to PHP (no JS allowed / no preventDefault)</p> 
<h2>üåº Nice to haves</h2>
<p>The user to choose between different currencies
    Provide a button to switch the from / to valuta types (So Euro -> Dollar becomes Dollar --> Euro)
    Need some help?
    Step by step guidance (up to you if you want it)</p> 
<ul>
<ol>1. Create the HTML you need</ol>
    - What elements does the form need?
<ol>2. Figure out what a form submit actually means / does</ol>
<ol>3. How to get the form data after the submit?</ol>
<ol>4. Calculate the amount in the desired valuta</ol>
<ol>5. Figure out a way to provide this data in the HTML</ol>
</ul>
<h3> Enjoy the drink üçπ</h3>
